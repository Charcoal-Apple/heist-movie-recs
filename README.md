  Despite the questionable accents and opportunity to slip into tropes about rednecks (which were mostly avoided), it ended up being a fun ride.

Some fun heist implementation strategy, characters you wanna root for, and a surprising amount of heart and charm. Not the most high-art heist movie ever made, but a thoroughly enjoyable watch
