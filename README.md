This movie was much more of an "intricate clockwork" heist than the others so far. The multiple views of the same timeline style of storytelling works well for this. 
 It brings together an unlikely crew (but without quite the unique specialization that makes oceans 11 / the Italian job so fun).

Some great acting performances add another layer of intrigue and tension

I think this ended up being a keystone for heist movies to follow.

Not a ton of flashy strategy, but just enough. Not a huge amount of character development, but some fun personalities. Lots of very newyorkian flavor. It's biggest strength is the tension of the negotiation in my opinion

  Despite the questionable accents and opportunity to slip into tropes about rednecks (which were mostly avoided), it ended up being a fun ride.

Some fun heist implementation strategy, characters you wanna root for, and a surprising amount of heart and charm. Not the most high-art heist movie ever made, but a thoroughly enjoyable watch
